		<p>There are <u>food lovers</u>, and then, there are <u>food connoisseurs</u>. These are the people who not only enjoy eating but also love to share their eating experiences, views, suggestions and recipes with the world at large. The food bloggers who started documenting their food journey as a hobby have now become professional influencers who rule the culinary world in various capacities. The beauty of food bloggers is that they not only talk about well-known eateries or a type of cuisine but also bring to the forefront small eateries and rare traditional food that might have got lost in the new millennia, showing the world that good food doesn’t need glam and glitter. Mumbai is one such place where you can find eateries at every corner, and sometimes a gem thanks to the passionate Mumbai food bloggers.</p>
		<p>This blog is about life, its experiences and its engaging effect coupled with a propelling force which drives me to my ultimate destination – food. This blog will open up an exciting world of cooking for you and entice you to don that apron and whip the same in your kitchens.</p>
		<p>I fuel my passion further by serving as a <i>restaurant consultant</i>, especially on menu and design, dabbled in <i>collaborations with top chefs from India</i>, set up several <i>QSR’s (Quick Service Restaurants)</i> and <i>conceptualized restaurants</i> for hospitality groups in India.</p>
